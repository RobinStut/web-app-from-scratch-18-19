# Pok√©mon API

The API I‚Äôm using contains all the Pok√©mon names existing and an URL to the detail page. Every detail page needs his own API request and the data contains all the information about the Pok√©mon and in which games it participated. There is a restriction on the API which forces me to only load 20 Pokemon‚Äôs at a time.

## How to install

```
git clone https://github.com/RobinStut/web-app-from-scratch-18-19.git

cd web-app-from-scratch-18-19/week1
```

## The data itself 

The data will be received by a request to the API. The request method I‚Äôm using at the moment is a 'XMLHttpRequest', which I will adapt to an 'async/await' or 'promise' based request later on.

### `API Request` (XHR)

The API request I used is happening by a XMLHttpRequest. This allows me to get data from a specific (external) source. With the help of MDN, you are able to see how I did this:  [here](https://github.com/RobinStut/web-app-from-scratch-18-19/blob/master/week1/public/js/app.js).

### API Data

The data I get from the API request can be seen on this link: ‚Äòhttps://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon' and a detail page on this link:https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/bulbasaur/ 

The result I get is:

```json
{"count":964,"next":"https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/?offset=20&limit=20","previous":null,"results":[{"name":"bulbasaur","url":"https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/1/"},{"name":"ivysaur","url":"https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/2/"},{"name":"venusaur","url":"https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/3/"},{"name":"charmander","url":"https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/4/"},{"name":"charmeleon","url":"https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/5/"},{"name":"charizard","url":"https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/6/"},{"name":"squirtle","url":"https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/7/"},{"name":"wartortle","url":"https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/8/"},{"name":"blastoise","url":"https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/9/"},{"name":"caterpie","url":"https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/10/"},{"name":"metapod","url":"https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/11/"},{"name":"butterfree","url":"https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/12/"},{"name":"weedle","url":"https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/13/"},{"name":"kakuna","url":"https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/14/"},{"name":"beedrill","url":"https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/15/"},{"name":"pidgey","url":"https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/16/"},{"name":"pidgeotto","url":"https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/17/"},{"name":"pidgeot","url":"https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/18/"},{"name":"rattata","url":"https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/19/"},{"name":"raticate","url":"https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/20/"}]}
```

Like I said earlier, the API restricts me from retrieving more than 20 results, but can be bypassed by adapting the API link. The data I use for now is very small, but will be extended by some data from every detail page.

## About Web App From Scratch

I'm working on this application during the Web App From Scratch course. During this course we focus on building a native HTML, CSS & JavaScript application, so no frameworks or unnecessary libraries.

### Schedule 

**Week 1** Hello API üêí

- [x] In week 1 we get used to pick up data from an API and render that in HTML.

[Repository](https://github.com/RobinStut/web-app-from-scratch-18-19/blob/master/week1/public/js/app.js)

**Week 2** - Design and Refactor üõ†

- [ ] In week 2 we try to make breakdowns in the web app. Also we will be adding routes and multiple states. A detail page will be rendered as well.

[Repository]()

**Week 3**- Wrapping up üéÅ

- [ ] In week 3 we try to manipulating data, Splitting code into modules and reflect with each other  on the end results
